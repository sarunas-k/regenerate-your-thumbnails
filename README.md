## Make variations of registered image sizes for all uploaded images

 This is a plugin which is supposed to be used after [registering additional image size in Wordpress](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_image_size/). New image uploads get all sizes, but previous images need to be updated. You can run this plugin and save time by not doing it manually.
